# COVID19-METRICS (REACT-REDUX-CAPSTONE)
 This a React capstone project and its about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that i have created using React and Redux.

I will select an API that provides numeric data about a topic that i like and then build the webapp around it. The webapp will have several pages:

 - one page with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters; This page will be my homepage.
 - one page for the item details;
